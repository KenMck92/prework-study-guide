# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I enrolled in this course because I wanted a change in my career and I have always loved coding. Knowing that I have the right tools and information to help me better learn the ins and outs of coding is what motivates me to want to keep pushing forward. I built this project because it explains and breaks down how every component of coding works and the issues that causes them not to work. This project helped me with a lot of problem solving issues I have with coding, very small problems that can be easily over looked or misunderstood this project helped me look very closley at my work.
